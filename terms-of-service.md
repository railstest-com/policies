# Terms of Service

Last updated: June 07, 2022

Thank you for choosing Rails Test to assist your organization in your hiring process for new Ruby on Rails engineers.

When we say “Company”, “we”, “our”, or “us” in this document, we are referring to Furvur Inc d/b/a Rails Test and RailsTest.com.

When we say “Services”, we mean any product or service created by and sold by Furvur Inc under the Rails Test brand. At this time, this primarily includes our productized service of testing potential developer-hire candidates with Ruby on Rails code challenges and offering an analysis of their work and performance on our code challenges.

When we say “You” or “your”, we are referring to the people or organizations who have purchased our product and/or service from Rails Test.

We may update these Terms of Service in the future. You can track all changes made on GitHub.

When you use our Services, now or in the future, you are agreeing to the latest Terms of Service. That's true for any of our existing and future products and all features that we add to our Services over time. There may be times where we do not exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms of Service; in doing so, we are not waiving that right or provision. These terms do contain a limitation of our liability.

If you violate any of the terms, we may terminate your account with us and cease to provide you with our service. We do not take such decisions lightly, but such statements are necessarily broad to ensure that we can maintain our high standard of operation to our entire customer base.

## Account Terms

## Payment, Refunds, and Plan Changes

## Cancellation and Termination

## Modifications to the Service and Prices

We may modify the price of our Services at any time. When we do change the price, any previously purchased but not yet delivered Services will not be required to be paid the difference between the old and new price.

However, any additional upgrades or modifications to already purchased Services will be subject to our new pricing structure.

## Service Delivery Standard, Uptime, Security, and Privacy

1. Your use of the Services is at your sole risk. We provide these Services on an “as is” and “as available” basis. Although we adhere to our own internal standard of delivery, this is not guaranteed.

2. We reserve the right to cancel any order due to any reason at our discretion, even after the delivery of our Service.

3. We take many measures to protect and secure your data through backups, redundancies, and encryption. We enforce encryption for data transmission from the public Internet. There are some edge cases where we may send your data through our network unencrypted.

4. We adhere to the privacy policy as set forth in our [Privacy Policy](privacy-policy.md).

5. We use third party vendors and hosting partners to provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and related technology required to run the Services. Your use of our Service means you agree that third party vendors and hosting parties may also have access to your data.

6. We do not provide an uptime SLA for our Service.

## Copyright and Content Ownership

1. You agree not to reproduce or modify any information we provide to you. Specifically, you agree not to reutilize our coding challenges. Our coding challenges are specifically designed for use by Rails Test only and is copyrighted.

2. You agree not to share the results of our analysis with any organization outside of your own.

3. You agree not to reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, resell or exploit any portion of the Services, use of the Services, or access to the Services without the express written permission by the Company.

## Liability

We mention liability throughout these Terms but to put it all in one section:

You expressly understand and agree that the Company shall not be liable, in law or in equity, to you or to any third party for any direct, indirect, incidental, lost profits, special, consequential, punitive or exemplary damages, including, but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data or other intangible losses (even if the Company has been advised of the possibility of such damages), resulting from: (i) the use or the inability to use the Services; (ii) the cost of procurement of substitute goods and services resulting from any goods, data, information or services purchased or obtained or messages received or transactions entered into through or from the Services; (iii) unauthorized access to or alteration of your transmissions or data; (iv) statements or conduct of any third party on the service; (v) or any other matter relating to this Terms of Service or the Services, whether as a breach of contract, tort (including negligence whether active or passive), or any other theory of liability.

In other words: choosing to use our Services does mean you are making a bet on us. If the bet does not work out, that's on you, not us. We do our best to provide you with a reliable productized service. Although our service includes an analysis of your hiring candidates' technical ability in Ruby and Ruby on Rails, we only act in an advisory capacity. Ultimately, you control and own all responsibilities and consequences of your hiring decisions.

If you have a question about any of the Terms of Service, please contact our Support team.
