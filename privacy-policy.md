# Privacy Policy

Last updated: June 07, 2022

In this policy, we lay out: what data we collect and why; how your data is handled; and your rights to your data. As we are solely in the business of providing a service to businesses, and so we do not sell your data.

This policy applies to all services by Rails Test, which is operated by Furvur Inc.

## What we collect and why

We only collect what we need. Here’s what that means:

### Identity & access

For businesses who make a purchase at Rails Test, we ask for identifying information such as your name, email address, a company name, and your address. This information is used for issuing you a correct invoice and to contact you about your order. We do not sell your personal info to third parties, and we won’t use your name or company in marketing statements without your permission either.

### Billing information

When you pay for our services, we ask for your credit card and billing address. That’s so we can charge you for service, calculate taxes due, and send you invoices. Your credit card is passed directly to our payment processor and does not ever go through our servers.

We store a record of the payment transaction, including the last 4 digits of the credit card number and as-of billing address, for account history, invoicing, and billing support. We store your billing address to calculate any sales tax due according to the jurisdiction of our operation (Ontario, Canada), to detect fraudulent credit card transactions, and to print on your invoices.

### Geolocation data

We log all access to all accounts by full IP address so that we can always verify no unauthorized access has happened. We keep this login data for as long as your account is active.

### Website interactions

When you browse any page under the RailsTest.com domain, your browser automatically shares certain information such as which operating system and browser version you are using. We track that information, along with the pages you are visiting, page load timing, and which website referred you for statistical purposes like conversion rates and to test new designs.

We sometimes track specific link clicks to help inform some design decisions. These web analytics data are tied to your IP address.

### Anti-bot assessments

We use [CAPTCHA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAPTCHA) services across our applications to mitigate brute force logins as a means of spam protection. We have a legitimate interest in protecting our pages from spam and attacks.

When you log into your accounts and fill specific forms, the CAPTCHA service evaluates various information (e.g IP address, how long the visitor has been on the app, mouse movements) to check whether the data is possibly filled out by an automated program instead of a human. We retain these data via our subprocessor forever because they are used for anti-spam mitigation.

### Cookies and Do Not Track

We do use persistent first-party cookies to store certain preferences, make it easier for you to use the services provided by us, and support some in-house analytics.

We partner with Google for some marketing activities. If you are coming to Rails Test from a Google ad, Google will send a cookie to your browser to determine whether you visited RailsTest.com because of a particular advertisement you viewed. This enables us to evaluate the effectiveness of these ads.

A cookie is a piece of text stored by your browser. It may help remember login information and site preferences. It might also collect information such as your browser type, operating system, web pages visited, duration of visit, content viewed, and other click-stream data. You can adjust cookie retention settings in your own browser. To learn more about cookies, including how to view which cookies have been set and how to manage and delete them, please visit: [www.allaboutcookies.org](https://www.allaboutcookies.org).

At this time, our sites and applications do not respond to Do Not Track beacons sent by browser plugins.

### Voluntary correspondence

When you write Rails Test with a question or to ask for help, we keep that correspondence, including the email address, so that we have a history of past correspondences to reference if you reach out in the future.

We also store any information you volunteer like surveys. Sometimes when we do customer interviews, we may ask for your permission to record the conversation for future reference or use. We only do so if you give your express consent.

### Information we do not collect

We don’t collect any characteristics of protected classifications including age, race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, or physical and mental abilities or disabilities. You may provide these data voluntarily, such as if you include a pronoun preference in your email signature when writing into our Support team.

We also do not collect any biometric data. You are given the option to add a picture to your user profile, which could be a real picture of you or a picture of something else that represents you best. We do not extract any information from profile pictures: they are for your use alone.

## When we access or share your information

**For persons who complete the coding challenges**

For persons who complete code challenges (the Candidate), the complete result of their work and performance is shared to the person or business who ordered the coding challenge (the Service) and/or who invited the Candidate to complete the coding challenge.

As it is the nature of the business of Rails Test, we analyze the Candidate's work and performance according to our own opinion. We share this opinion with the person or business who ordered the Service.

Our opinion of the work and performance is not shared with the Candidate who completed the coding challenge as this information is private between Rails Test and original purchaser of the Service.

**When required under applicable law.**

Furvur Inc d/b/a Rails Test is a Canadian company. All data infrastructure are located in either the United States of America or Canada.

* If law enforcement authorities have the necessary warrant, criminal subpoena, or court order requiring we share data, we have to comply. Unless we’re legally prevented from it, we’ll always inform you when such requests are made.
* If we get an informal request from any person, organization, or entity, we do not assist. If you purchased a service from our website and is someone who wants to export data from their account, you can do so by logging into your Rails Test account and accessing the appropriate export function.
* If we are audited by a tax authority, we may be required to share billing-related information. If that happens, we only share the bare minimum needed such as billing addresses and tax exemption information.

Finally, if Rails Test is acquired by or merged with another company, we’ll notify you well before any info about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

## Your rights with respect to your information

Currently some of the most privacy-forward regulations in place are the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) and California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) in the US. Rails Test recognizes all of the rights granted in these regulations, except as limited by applicable law. These rights include:

* **Right to Know.** You have the right to know what personal information is collected, used, shared or sold. We outline both the categories and specific bits of data we collect, as well as how they are used, in this privacy policy.
* **Right of Access.** This includes your right to access the personal information we gather about you, and your right to obtain information about the sharing, storage, security and processing of that information. There are exceptions to this, such as if you are the person completing a coding challenge. In this case, the contents of the challenge, your work, your performance, and our opinion of the work and performance is not accessible to you. You may contact the business who invited you to complete the coding challenge for that information, which they may provide at their discretion.
* **Right to Correction.** You have the right to request correction of your personal information.
* **Right to Erasure / “To be Forgotten”.** This is your right to request, subject to certain limitations under applicable law, that your personal information be erased from our possession and, by extension, all of our service providers.
* **Right to Complain.** You have the right to make a complaint regarding our handling of your personal information with the appropriate supervisory authority. To identify your specific authority or find out more about this right, EU individuals should go to [https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en](https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en).
* **Right to Restrict Processing.** This is your right to request restriction of how and why your personal information is used or processed, including opting out of sale of personal information. Again, we are not in the business of selling personal data and do not engage in this practice.
* **Right to Object.** You have the right, in certain situations, to object to how or why your personal information is processed.
* **Right to Portability.** You have the right to receive the personal information we have about you and the right to transmit it to another party.
* **Right to not be subject to Automated Decision-Making.** You have the right to object and prevent any decision that could have a legal, or similarly significant, effect on you from being made solely based on automated processes. This right is limited, however, if the decision is necessary for performance of any contract between you and us, is allowed by applicable law, or is based on your explicit consent.
* **Right to Non-Discrimination.** This right stems from the CCPA. We do not and will not charge you a different amount to use our products, offer you different discounts, or give you a lower level of customer service because you have exercised your data privacy rights. However, the exercise of certain rights (such as the right “to be forgotten”) may, by virtue of your exercising those rights, prevent you from using our Services.

Many of these rights can be exercised by signing in and directly updating your account information.

If you have questions about exercising these rights or need assistance, please contact us at [support@railstest.com](mailto:support@railstest.com). For requests to delete personal information or know what personal information has been collected, we will first verify your identity using a combination of at least two pieces of information already collected including your user email address. If an authorized agent is corresponding on your behalf, we will first need written consent with a signature from the account holder before proceeding.

If you are in the EU, you can identify your specific authority to file a complaint or find out more about GDPR, at [https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en](https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en).

## How we secure your data

All data is encrypted via [SSL/TLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security) when transmitted from our servers to your browser.

## Location of site and data

Our products and other web properties are operated in Canada and in the United States. If you are located in the European Union or elsewhere outside of the United States, **please be aware that any information you provide to us will be transferred to and stored in Canada and in the United States**. By using our Site, participating in any of our services and/or providing us with your information, you consent to this transfer.

## Changes & questions

We may update this policy as needed to comply with relevant regulations and reflect any new practices. You can view a history of the changes to our policies [on GitHub](https://github.com/railstest-com/policies).
